  "version": "120-item (60 EQ, 60 SQ)",
  "description": "This questionnaire combines Simon Baron-Cohen's Empathizing Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ) tests. The EQ measures an individual's capacity to recognize and respond to the mental states of others, while the SQ measures an individual's drive to analyze or construct systems. You will be presented with 120 statements. Please rate each statement on a four-point scale from 'Strongly disagree' to 'Strongly agree', indicating how much you agree or disagree with it. Your responses will contribute to understanding your empathizing and systemizing tendencies. This test is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional psychological evaluation.",
