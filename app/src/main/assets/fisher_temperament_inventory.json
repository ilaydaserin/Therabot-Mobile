Fisher suggests combinations of these dimensions define four main 'temperament types': Explorer (high Curious/Energetic), Builder (high Cautious/Social Norm Compliant), Director (high Analytical/Tough-minded), and Negotiator (high Prosocial/Empathetic). Many individuals are a combination of two types (e.g., Explorer-Negotiator).",
